Hi there, curious hacker.

I'm passionate about **offensive cyber security**. I explore vulnerabilities, unexpected behaviors, obscure corners of Windows, Linux, networks, web apps and even malicious binaries we'd rather ignore.

I launched this blog to **document my research**, **share techniques**, and also **create a trace** of what fascinates me on a daily basis: the art of understanding a system to better exploit it.

## 🎯 My playgrounds

- **Pentest Web & Network**: I spend time looking for SQL injections, XSS, RCE, privilege escalations or pivot techniques. Understanding how network and web stacks work is essential to better circumvent them.
  
- **Reverse Engineering & Binary Exploitation**: I like to disassemble executables, read assembler, understand the internal logic of a program and write my own exploits, sometimes starting from a simple memory bug.

- **Malware Analysis**: Static or dynamic analysis, I like to track down malicious behavior, understand persistence mechanisms, spot C2s and extract payloads from an obscure binary.

- **Active Directory & Windows Internals**: I delve into the bowels of Windows, its security mechanisms, from UAC to protocol abuse in Active Directory environments. Microsoft systems are a rich and complex terrain.

- **Applied cryptography & CTF**: Without being a crypto-math, I like to play with implementation errors, misused modes and faulty PRNGs. Especially in CTF challenges, where nothing is really what it seems.

- **Linux & scripting**: Bash, Python or custom tools, I automate, monitor and bypass. A good script is sometimes better than a big tool.

- **Fun & Crackmes**: I like to code or solve small protected binaries. It's fun, cerebral, and it muscles the analysis.

## 👨‍💻 Why this blog?

Because I believe in **making visible** what is often hidden:

- The methods behind the tools.
- The ideas behind the feats.
- And the mistakes behind the successes.

It's also a way of sharing with the community. If you find a loophole, a useful write-up, or want to propose a twisted challenge: **let me know**.

# üß≠ Introduction 

Offensive cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and with it, technical certifications are diversifying to meet the expectations of professionals, recruiters and enthusiasts alike. Among the recent certifications making the news, Hack The Box's Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) is establishing itself as a serious, modern alternative to more traditional courses such as the OSCP.

I recently obtained this certification after completing the ‚ÄúPenetration Tester‚Äù course offered on the HTB Academy platform, and in this article I'd like to share my full feedback, while giving you an overview of what this course really offers: its strengths, its challenges, its organization, and of course, my tips for passing the final exam.

This article is aimed at those considering CPTS certification, but also more broadly at anyone interested in high-quality technical training in offensive cybersecurity. Whether you're a student, a retraining professional or already active in the field, I hope this testimonial will help you make an informed choice.

# üß± The ‚ÄúPenetration Tester‚Äù path on HTB Academy

## Progressive and well-structured training

Hack The Box's ‚ÄúPenetration Tester‚Äù path is much more than just a prerequisite for CPTS certification. It's a real skills-building program, combining accessible theory and intensive practice, designed to cover the different facets of the pentester's profession.

In all, the course comprises 28 modules, divided into several levels of difficulty. Each module is accompanied by :

- interactive lessons with illustrated explanations,
- practical labs (VMs to be attacked online),
- assessment quizzes to validate what you've learned.

You progress at your own pace, with a well-thought-out progression system. Some modules are very ‚Äúguided‚Äù, while others are more open-ended, forcing you to think like a real pentester.

## Key modules to remember

Here are a few modules that I believe form the backbone of the course - especially for passing the CPTS exam:

- *Enumeration* : probably the most critical module. Learning to detect services, ports, users and vulnerabilities is the basis of any effective pentest.
- *Privilege Escalation (Linux & Windows)* : essential for understanding how to go from basic access to total control over a system.
- *Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks* : this well-constructed module introduces BloodHound, Kerberoasting, pass-the-hash and other techniques often underestimated by beginners.
- *Tunneling & Pivoting* : many CPTS candidates underestimate this module, even though it is essential for progress in a partitioned infrastructure.
- *Reporting* : a real plus. It teaches you how to write a clear, professional report, as in a real customer contract, which is essential for the final exam.

## Tools and working environment

One of HTB Academy's strengths is that it provides an all-in-one cloud environment: no need to install VMs locally, everything is hosted in the cloud, with access via a pre-configured attack machine (HTB Pwnbox or your own VM via HTB VPN).

Must-have tools during the course:

- *Nmap, Gobuster, Nikto* : network & web enumeration
- *LinPEAS, WinPEAS, HTB custom scripts* : elevation of privileges
- *Impacket, Evil-WinRM, Rubeus, BloodHound* : AD exploitation
- *Chisel, SSH tunneling, Socat* : pivoting

üéØ Tip : creating a folder of cheatsheets sorted by phase (enumeration, exploitation, escalation) can really speed up the practical phase.

# ‚öîÔ∏è The CPTS exam: a real pentester test

## A unique format: 7 days to compromise a company

Unlike other certifications, which impose a limited 24 or 48-hour examination window, the CPTS offers a more realistic and less stressful format: you have 7 full days to audit and compromise a fictitious corporate infrastructure, followed by 7 days to hand in your professional report.

Objective: exploit a series of machines, pivot through the infrastructure, escalate privileges, retrieve key flags... all as in a real pentest mission.
The final report is mandatory to validate certification. It must include :

- Identified vulnerabilities
- Exploitation path
- Evidence (captures, commands, flags)
- Recommendations for remediation

üëâ The challenge is not only technical, but also methodological and editorial.

## My exam experience

I started the examination by first taking a few hours to map the environment: wide network scan with Nmap, locating segments, exposed machines, host names.

I quickly realized that the classic ‚ÄúCTF‚Äù approach would not suffice here. I had to be methodical, rigorous and, above all, document as I went along, lest I forget critical steps for the report.

üéØ My advice: don't rush through the operation. Take the time to note down everything: every order, every flag, every path operated. Your report depends on it.

## Difficulties encountered (and lessons learned)

The CPTS is not as brutal as the OSCP, but it should not be underestimated. Some difficulties I've encountered:

- 7-day time management: you think you've got room to maneuver, but you can easily lose 1 or 2 days on a misidentified pivot or a logical error.
- The temptation to ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù the machines, instead of thinking about the logical sequence of vulnerabilities.
- The stress of reporting, because you never really know if what you've included is enough (or too little).

üß† What I learned:

- You have to be organized, rigorous and well-documented.
- Reporting is as important as technique
- Have a clear pentest methodology (recognition > enumeration > exploitation > pivot > post-exploitation > proof)

# üéØ Tips for a successful CPTS

## Modules not to be overlooked

While all the modules in the course are useful, some are critical for the exam. If you really master them, you'll save an enormous amount of time and peace of mind during the exam.

- *Enumeration* : The lifeblood of the exam. You need to know what to scan, how to scan it and what to deduce from it. This module is the basis of all progress in the exam.
- *Privilege Escalation (Linux & Windows)* : Classic escalation vulnerabilities (SUID, Scheduled Tasks, etc.) are well represented. You need to be able to recognize them quickly.
- *Active Directory* : The exam lab includes several AD elements, and understanding how a domain works, trusts, SPNs or TGT tickets is a must.
- *Tunneling & Pivoting* : Very often neglected. And yet, if you don't master the creation of SSH tunnels, you'll be stuck at the door of critical segments.
- *Reporting* : It's not a bonus, it's a killer. One bad report = one failure. This module shows you how to write effectively, present evidence, and propose clear remedies.

## Organize efficiently during training and exams

Here are a few best practices I recommend:

During training:

- Don't skip quizzes: they force you to structure what you've just learned.
- Take organized notes (Obsidian, OneNote or simple Markdown).
- Redo some labs without help to evaluate yourself.
- Set up a personal exam-ready machine with all your favorite tools/scripts.

During the exam:

- Start with a wide, careful scan.
- Record every stage of your operation live (shared terminal with notepad or automatic capture).
- Complete the report throughout the exam.
- Don't wait until the last day to restart pivots or retrieve flags: think ahead.

# üß† My opinion on CPTS certification

## ‚úÖ Highlights

After completing the course and obtaining certification, several positive aspects stand out clearly:

- A modern teaching approach: The combination of well-popularized theory and interactive cloud labs is highly effective. You learn by doing, with a good balance between guidance and autonomy.
- Professional infrastructure: The exam lab mimics a real company, with network segmentation, Active Directory, escalation, pivoting... It's more realistic than many ‚ÄúCTF-style‚Äù labs.
- A well thought-out exam format: 7 days to carry out the pentest + and to write the report, which is comfortable enough to manage stress without compromising technical requirements.
- A real emphasis on reporting, often underestimated elsewhere. Here, it's a central skill, valued in the certification process.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses

- Not yet very well known on the market (especially outside the HTB community): the name ‚ÄúCPTS‚Äù is still in its infancy compared to OSCP or PNPT. It may be some time before it is more widely recognized by all recruiters.Weaknesses


>üîö Want to take the plunge?
>  - Embark on HTB's Penetration Tester course, take the time to assimilate the modules, and treat the exam like a real customer assignment. You'll come out of it not only certified... but also much more technically sound.
